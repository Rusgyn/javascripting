function eat (food){
  return food + ' tasted really good.'
}

console.log(eat('bananas')) //OUTPUT: bananas tasted really good.


// *My other solution

// function eat (food){
//   let what = 'bananas'
//   return what + ' tasted really good.'  
// }

// console.log(eat()) //OUTPUT: bananas tasted really good.
